# wine-builder
my personal wine-builder "system" for use on puppylinux or puppy derivates {puplets}
The milestone marks a "should work on any system" state since the first builds were only meant to work on my personal distro frankenpup

I think that due to my latest updates this sould actually build on any system, regardless if it is a puppylinux based distro or not, not sure tho, needs testing.
